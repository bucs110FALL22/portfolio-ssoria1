# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION:

This program display accurate information of the characters of the series "Rick and Morty" and from Pokemon using their respectives APIs. Going to the purpose of establishing any pokemon that you want in any episode of the animated series, having an interactive program with a funny incorporation of the pokemons. 


## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:

In the difficulties that I got were obtain a way of distributions of the information of the characters and pokemons, by which at the final I just stay with the program that responds to the respectives characters of one episode, and a range of pokemons that you want to add in the interplay.


## REFERENCES:

I prefer to use functions and loops to perform a good and considerate program, besides getting a start and comfortable knowledge of the application of APIs. 


## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:

Well despite that the combination of ideas looks weird, in fact it really comes to be ingenuous. I could consider that I made a program understanding new modules (json and requests) along with APIs to a weird interactions between two different and funny environments.
