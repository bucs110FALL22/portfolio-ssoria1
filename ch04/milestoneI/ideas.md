# Final Project Milestone #1

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is  uch easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

My first idea is about a game having as main feature, a character using the turtle module with the adding about that you can controle the motions of the object using the arrow keys and perform a skill that is about using the pen command to create a line that once you circle enemies, you can beat them.

## Project Idea 2

My second idea is a translate, using matrices between the amount of languages used. Of course there would be an specific input to each command.

## Project Idea 3

The last idea is about an interactive simulation according your choices. There would be like a simulation and every decision that you pick is going to be reflected in the simulation.
