# CS110 Midterm Exam
## Description:
In this opportunity, the program carry out the drawing of a extinct amphibian, "Diplocaulus" in a cartoon style made by different shapes. One of the things that I wanted to highlight is how drawings can be made and conformed by various and numerous shapes as a base to create and draw anything.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS 

One of the main difficulties that I got is defining some commands to generate a shape or even sometimes I needed to consider some shapes that I assume for the final job. Also despite that I could add more features, the program started to get delays when I was trying to run it, at final I made a  code with a lot of functions to form the drawing.



## REFERENCES

I think I use more tools and commands not used in classes like filling of color, circle, etc. By which, this result interesting to play with them to obtain different ways to illustrate a drawing. 



## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS
When I was working with the design, I was discovering new and considerable decisions to set. In other words, despite that I imagine results in a different expectation, after all I could state that I liked because I feel that I could set and state an original work made by my own way, either be playing with commands and learning more about them through mistakes and errors, and of course my imagination.
